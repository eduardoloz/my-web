      "description": "A simulation of massive pulleys. Done for Physics C final project.",
      "long-description": "The simulation is done in GlowScript, a Python library that allows for 3D graphics. The simulation is a 3D representation of a massive pulley system with mass on ends of a string. There are four pre built configurations with static and nonstatic pulleys (where they have translational movement as well). Users can change the masses attached at the end as well as see graphs of velocity and displacement. This was one of the most fun projects I've worked on.",
